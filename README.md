# Tuning Hyperparameters of SVM
 
If an SVM classifier trained with an RBF kernel underfits the training set, there might be too much regularization. To decrease it, you need to increase gamma or C (or both)???

A common approach to finding the correct values ​​for the
hyperparameter is to use Grid (or Random) Search.
Having a good sense of what each hyperparameter actually does can also help you look in the right part of the
hyperparameter space.

If I can tune it interactively, I understand better!
